# File Uploader

This is an internal web application that allows users on the same LAN to upload, manage, and share files easily. It provides a simple, intuitive interface to upload various file types (documents, images, videos‚Ä¶), with access control to keep data secure. Because it runs on a local network, file transfers are fast and stable without relying on the Internet.

This is an **internal-use** product. It can integrate with other storage solutions such as Google File Store, S3, etc.
